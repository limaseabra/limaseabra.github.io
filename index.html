<h2 id="post1">vim scripts for handling base64</h2>

<p>
I have been working with files that contain base64 encoded data that I need to view and edit.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty tired of running "base64" at the command line all the time, so I came up with a simple vimscript.
</p>

<p>
Basically what I do is visual select the text I want to encode/decode, and then call the following (mapped) functions to decode or encode the selection.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
vnoremap &#x3C;leader&#x3E;bsd :&#x3C;c-u&#x3E;call &#x3C;SID&#x3E;BaseDecoder()&#x3C;cr&#x3E;
vnoremap &#x3C;leader&#x3E;bse :&#x3C;c-u&#x3E;call &#x3C;SID&#x3E;BaseEncoder()&#x3C;cr&#x3E;

function! s:BaseDecoder()
    let saved_unnamed_register = @@
    normal! &#x60;&#x3C;v&#x60;&#x3E;y
    let @@ = system(&#x22;base64 -d&#x22;, getreg(&#x22;&#x22;))
    set splitright | vnew | normal! p
    let @@ = saved_unnamed_register
endfunction

function! s:BaseEncoder()
    let saved_unnamed_register = @@
    normal! &#x60;&#x3C;v&#x60;&#x3E;y
    let @@ = system(&#x22;base64 -w 0&#x22;, getreg(&#x22;&#x22;))
    set splitright | vnew | normal! p
    let @@ = saved_unnamed_register
endfunction
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The functions are pretty simple (and probably could be one-liners): I yank the visual selection, pass it to the system base64, and the output is pasted in a new window. As usual with vimscripts, the used unnamed register is restored to its previous value (this way we don't replace a previous yank).
</p>

<p>
There are probably plugins out there that already do this better, but I find it pretty satisfying to play with these little scripts.
</p>

<h2 id="post2">vim copy to clipboard</h2>

<p>
This is how I copy visual selected text to the clipboard:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
vnoremap &#x3C;F9&#x3E; :&#x3C;c-u&#x3E;call &#x3C;SID&#x3E;CopyToClipboard()&#x3C;cr&#x3E;

function! s:CopyToClipboard()
    let saved_unnamed_register = @@
    normal! &#x60;&#x3C;v&#x60;&#x3E;y
    call system(&#x22;xclip -sel clipboard&#x22;, getreg(&#x22;&#x22;))
    let @@ = saved_unnamed_register
endfunction
